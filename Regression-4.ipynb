    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that extends ordinary least squares (OLS) regression by adding a \n",
    "regularization term to the objective function. The regularization term includes the absolute values of the regression \n",
    "coefficients multiplied by a tuning parameter (λ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences from Other Regression Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity Inducing:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main differences is that Lasso Regression introduces sparsity by setting some coefficients to exactly zero. \n",
    "This is in contrast to Ridge Regression, which shrinks coefficients towards zero but rarely sets them exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is particularly effective for feature selection. If there are irrelevant or redundant features in the \n",
    "dataset, Lasso can eliminate them by assigning zero coefficients to those features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of the absolute values of coefficients in the regularization term makes the Lasso objective function \n",
    "non-differentiable at zero, which can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero. This property is in contrast to \n",
    "Ridge Regression, where the regularization term includes the squared values of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression handles multicollinearity (high correlation among predictor variables) by effectively selecting one variable \n",
    "from a group of correlated variables and setting the coefficients of the others to zero. This can simplify the model and \n",
    "improve interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effect on Coefficient Magnitudes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso penalty tends to result in more significant shrinkage of coefficients compared to Ridge Regression. Variables with\n",
    "non-zero coefficients in Lasso tend to have larger effects on the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of Tuning Parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning parameter (λ) in Lasso Regression controls the trade-off between data fit and sparsity. The selection of an \n",
    "appropriate λ involves techniques such as cross-validation."
